## Strategic Framework

### Business Case Development

#### 1. Value Assessment Matrix

| Dimension | Traditional Method | Digital Twin Method | Improvement Factor |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Speed | Weeks/Months | Hours/Days | 10-100x |
| Cost | $10K-$100K+ | $1K-$10K | 5-20x |
| Scale | 10-100 participants | 1,000-10,000 personas | 100-1000x |
| Iteration | Limited by budget/time | Unlimited | ∞ |

#### 2. ROI Calculation Framework

**Cost Savings Formula:**
```
ROI = (Traditional_Method_Cost - Digital_Twin_Cost) / Digital_Twin_Cost × 100%

Example:
Traditional focus group: $50,000
Digital twin research: $5,000
ROI = ($50,000 - $5,000) / $5,000 = 900%
```

**Revenue Impact Formula:**
```
Revenue_Impact = (Improved_Decision_Rate × Average_Decision_Value × Decision_Frequency)

Example:
20% better marketing decisions × $100K average campaign × 12 campaigns/year
= $240K additional annual revenue
```

#### 3. Use Case Prioritization Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Business Impact | 30% | | |
| Technical Feasibility | 25% | | |
| Data Availability | 20% | | |
| Stakeholder Buy-in | 15% | | |
| Regulatory Risk | 10% | | |

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- **5**: Transformational impact, proven technology, rich data available
- **3**: Moderate impact, standard implementation, adequate data
- **1**: Limited impact, complex implementation, minimal data
